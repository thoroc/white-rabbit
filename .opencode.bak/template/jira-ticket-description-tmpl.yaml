# Additional Metadata
title: "JIRA Ticket Description Template"
reference: "docs/jira-ticket-creation-system.md"

# Overview:
# This template provides standardized formats for different JIRA ticket types (stories, bugs, tasks, epics).
# Each format includes MoSCoW prioritization to help teams focus on essential requirements and manage scope.
# All templates emphasize clear acceptance criteria, measurable outcomes, and actionable descriptions.

# Structure Guidelines:
# 1. Choose the appropriate template based on ticket type (story, bug, task, or epic)
# 2. Include clear user story or problem statement
# 3. Use MoSCoW prioritization to distinguish must-haves from nice-to-haves
# 4. Write specific, testable acceptance criteria with measurable outcomes
# 5. Keep titles concise (8-12 words) and descriptive

# Guidelines:

guidelines:
  ticket_type_selection:
    - "Story: Use for new features from user perspective"
    - "Bug: Use for defects, errors, and incorrect behavior"
    - "Task: Use for technical work, infrastructure, refactoring, tech debt"
    - "Epic: Use for large initiatives requiring 3+ stories or 2+ weeks"
  
  writing_acceptance_criteria:
    given_when_then:
      use_for: "User interactions, workflows, and behavioral requirements"
      format: "Given [context], When [action], Then [outcome]"
    
    checklist_format:
      use_for: "System behaviors, validation rules, and quality requirements"
      format: "- [ ] [Specific, testable requirement]"
  
  moscow_prioritization:
    must_have: "Non-negotiable (3-6 items, 60% effort) - Can't deliver without these"
    should_have: "Important but deferrable (2-4 items, 20% effort) - Significant value impact"
    could_have: "Nice to have (1-3 items, 15% effort) - Easy to defer"
    wont_have: "Out of scope (5% buffer) - Explicitly not doing"
  
  best_practices:
    - "Keep titles to 8-12 words - clear and scannable"
    - "Write acceptance criteria that are specific and testable"
    - "Include metrics in AC (time, quantity, percentage)"
    - "Focus on outcomes, not implementation details"
    - "Cover edge cases and error handling, not just happy path"
    - "Use MoSCoW to make scope negotiation explicit"
    - "Link dependencies to prevent blocking"
    - "Add evidence for bugs (screenshots, logs, errors)"

# Metrics Examples:

metrics_examples:
  performance: "< 2 seconds load time, < 500ms API response, < 1 second search"
  quantity: "10 results/page, 10K concurrent users, 10MB file limit"
  quality: "95% success rate, zero data loss, 80%+ test coverage"
  usability: "3-click tasks, helpful error messages, WCAG 2.1 AA accessible"

# Common Mistakes to Avoid:

common_mistakes:
  - "Vague acceptance criteria: 'Works well' vs 'Loads in < 2 seconds'"
  - "Too many Must Haves: 10+ items means unclear priorities"
  - "Implementation details in story: 'Use React hooks' vs 'User can filter results'"
  - "Missing edge cases: Only happy path, no error handling"
  - "No measurable outcomes: 'Fast' vs '< 2 seconds'"
  - "Unclear dependencies: Blocking work not identified"
  - "No definition of done: Unclear when ticket is complete"
