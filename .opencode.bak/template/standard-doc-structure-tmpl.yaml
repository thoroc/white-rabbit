# Additional Metadata
title: "Standard Documentation Structure"
reference: "docs/template-standard.md"

# Overview:
# This template defines the standard structure for organizing documentation across OpenCode projects.
# It establishes consistent file naming, directory layout, and content organization patterns that
# all documentation commands should follow when generating documentation files.

# Structure Guidelines:
# 1. Maintain clear separation between project README and detailed docs directory
# 2. Use dedicated files for each documentation type (api, architecture, deployment, etc.)
# 3. Follow consistent naming conventions (lowercase, kebab-case for multi-word)
# 4. Place all detailed documentation in a central docs/ directory
# 5. Keep README.md at project root as high-level entry point

# Naming Conventions:

naming_conventions:
  general:
    - "Use lowercase for all documentation files"
    - "Use kebab-case for multi-word filenames (e.g., getting-started.md)"
    - "Always use .md extension for markdown files"
    - "Keep filenames descriptive but concise"
  
  special_files:
    README.md: "Always uppercase, lives at project root"
    CONTRIBUTING.md: "Optional, uppercase if included at root"
    CHANGELOG.md: "Optional, uppercase if included at root"
    LICENSE: "Optional, no extension, uppercase"

# Guidelines:

guidelines:
  when_to_use:
    - "When generating documentation for any OpenCode project"
    - "When organizing existing documentation into standard structure"
    - "When creating documentation commands that generate multiple files"
    - "When onboarding new projects to documentation standards"
  
  when_not_to_use:
    - "For non-documentation files (source code, configs, etc.)"
    - "For single-file documentation projects"
    - "For external documentation sites with different structure requirements"
  
  best_practices:
    - "Start with README.md and docs/development.md as minimum viable documentation"
    - "Add specialized docs (api.md, deployment.md) as project needs grow"
    - "Keep README.md focused and link to detailed docs for depth"
    - "Update documentation in parallel with code changes"
    - "Use consistent formatting and structure across all docs"
    - "Include diagrams and examples where helpful"

# Content Principles:

content_principles:
  clarity:
    - "Use clear, concise language appropriate for the audience"
    - "Define technical terms and acronyms on first use"
    - "Structure content with clear headings and sections"
    - "Use examples and diagrams to illustrate complex concepts"
  
  completeness:
    - "Cover all necessary aspects for the documentation type"
    - "Include practical examples and common use cases"
    - "Document error conditions and troubleshooting steps"
    - "Link to related documentation and external resources"
  
  maintainability:
    - "Keep documentation close to the code it describes"
    - "Use relative links for cross-references within docs"
    - "Version documentation alongside code changes"
    - "Review and update docs regularly"

# Common Patterns:

common_patterns:
  linking_between_docs:
    description: "Pattern for cross-referencing documentation files"
    example: |
      # In README.md
      See [Development Guide](docs/development.md) for setup instructions.
      
      # In docs/development.md
      See [Architecture](architecture.md) for system design.
      See [API Reference](api.md) for API details.
  
  progressive_disclosure:
    description: "Start broad in README, link to specific details in docs/"
    use_case: "Avoid overwhelming users with too much information up front"
    example: |
      # README.md: High-level overview with links
      # docs/development.md: Detailed setup steps
      # docs/architecture.md: Deep technical details

# Integration:

integration:
  with_documentation_commands:
    description: "All documentation generation commands should follow this structure"
    commands: ["/api-docs", "/arch-docs", "/deploy-docs", "/dev-docs", "/onboard-docs", "/pipeline-docs"]
    behavior: "Commands check for docs/ directory and create files in standard locations"
  
  with_project_structure:
    description: "Documentation structure complements code organization"
    note: "Keep docs/ at same level as src/, tests/, and other project directories"
  
  with_version_control:
    description: "Documentation files are version controlled alongside code"
    best_practice: "Include docs in same commits as related code changes"

# Maintenance:

maintenance:
  review_frequency: "Review structure when adding new documentation types or major project changes"
  update_triggers:
    - "New documentation types needed (add to structure)"
    - "Project grows and needs more specialized docs"
    - "Team feedback on documentation organization"
    - "Changes to OpenCode documentation standards"
  version_control:
    - "Version this template alongside OpenCode configuration"
    - "Update all documentation commands when structure changes"
    - "Communicate structure changes to all team members"

# Best Practices Summary:

best_practices:
  - "Keep README.md at root as single entry point for all users"
  - "Place all detailed documentation in docs/ directory"
  - "Use consistent naming (lowercase, .md extension)"
  - "Link from README to detailed docs, not the reverse"
  - "Start minimal (README + development.md) and grow as needed"
  - "Update documentation in parallel with code changes"
  - "Use relative links for cross-references within documentation"
  - "Include diagrams and examples where they add clarity"
