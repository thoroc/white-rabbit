multi-source analysis (5-10+ sources), and scholarly reporting.

## Usage

```bash
/research <specific research topic or question>
```

## Examples

```bash
# Deep technology research
/research What are the best practices for implementing OAuth2 in Node.js applications?

# Problem deep-dive research
/research Why is our Lambda function experiencing cold start issues and how can we optimize it?

# Comparative deep analysis
/research Compare GraphQL vs REST APIs for microservices architecture

# Best practices deep research
/research What are the current best practices for securing Kubernetes clusters in production?

# Tool evaluation research
/research Evaluate Terraform vs Pulumi for infrastructure as code

# Trend analysis research
/research What are the emerging trends in serverless architecture for 2025?
```

## What This Command Does

The `/research` command leverages the researcher agent to:

1. **Exhaustive Source Gathering**: Fetch data from 5-10+ authoritative web sources, documentation, and local files
2. **Deep Multi-Layered Analysis**: Conduct surface, intermediate, and expert-level analysis
3. **Rigorous Verification**: Triple-check critical information across independent sources
4. **Scholarly Reporting**: Deliver comprehensive reports with multi-layered insights and complete source attribution
5. **Expert Context**: Include historical context, design rationale, and expert perspectives

## Deep Research Process

### Phase 1: Research Scope & Strategy

- Define precise research topic and objectives
- Identify 5-10 key research questions
- Determine depth requirements (surface, intermediate, expert)
- Map out source categories (primary, secondary, tertiary)
- Create research strategy with milestones

### Phase 2: Exhaustive Information Gathering (5-10+ Sources)

- Fetch 5-10+ authoritative primary sources
- Analyze technical implementations and examples
- Gather expert perspectives and design rationale
- Research historical context and evolution
- Document all sources meticulously

### Phase 3: Deep Analysis & Synthesis

- Triple-verify critical information across sources
- Conduct multi-layered analysis (surface → intermediate → expert)
- Identify patterns, trends, and connections
- Perform critical evaluation of evidence quality
- Synthesize findings into coherent framework

### Phase 4: Scholarly Reporting

- Structure findings with depth indicators
- Create visual knowledge maps using Mermaid
- Highlight multi-layered insights
- Provide evidence-based recommendations
- Include complete source attribution (5-10+ sources)

## Output Format

## Best Practices

### For Best Results

✅ **DO:**

- Be **highly specific** about the research topic
- Provide **context** about why you need deep understanding
- Mention **specific aspects** requiring expert-level analysis
- Indicate if you need **multi-dimensional comparisons**
- Specify desired **depth level** (surface/intermediate/expert)
- Request **historical context** if relevant to understanding

❌ **DON'T:**

- Ask overly broad questions without focus (researcher excels at **specific** deep dives)
- Expect research on proprietary systems without access
- Request real-time data requiring live system access
- Ask for speculation without evidence basis

### Example: Good vs Poor Requests

**Poor**: "Tell me about databases"

**Good**: "Research the best database options for a high-traffic e-commerce platform handling 10M+ transactions per day, comparing PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and DynamoDB. Include multi-source analysis of performance characteristics, scalability patterns, consistency models, and operational complexity with expert perspectives."

**Poor**: "Why is my app slow?"

**Good**: "Research performance bottlenecks in Node.js APIs experiencing 2-3 second response times under load. Conduct deep analysis of database query optimization, caching strategies, connection pooling, and profiling techniques from 5-10+ authoritative sources."

## Integration with Other Resources

This command uses the researcher agent which has access to:

### Tasks

- Technology detection for codebase analysis
- Infrastructure analysis for system research
- Deployment strategy analysis for operational research

### Knowledge Base

- Mermaid diagrams for visualization
- Loading strategy for efficient research

### Other Agents

- Can collaborate with code-architect for architecture research
- Can work with documentalist for documentation research
- Can coordinate with ai-tool-reviewer for tool evaluation

## When to Use This Command

Use `/research` when you need:

- ✅ **Deep, exhaustive research** on a specific technical topic (5-10+ sources)
- ✅ **Expert-level understanding** with multi-layered analysis
- ✅ **Rigorous evaluation** of technologies, tools, or approaches
- ✅ **Deep root cause analysis** with historical context
- ✅ **Comprehensive best practices** research from multiple authorities
- ✅ **Multi-dimensional comparative analysis** across alternatives
- ✅ **Trend analysis** with historical evolution and future trajectory
- ✅ **Implementation guidance** backed by authoritative sources

**Don't use** `/research` for:

- ❌ Simple factual questions (ask directly - researcher is for **deep dives**)
- ❌ Code generation or modification (use appropriate agents)
- ❌ Documentation creation (use `/document` or `/documentalist`)
- ❌ Ticket creation (use `/create-ticket`)
- ❌ Quick surface-level answers (researcher emphasizes **depth and rigor**)

## Tips for Effective Deep Research

1. **Be Highly Specific**: The more specific your topic, the deeper and more valuable the research
2. **Provide Rich Context**: Share background, constraints, and why deep understanding matters
3. **Define Success Criteria**: Mention what expert-level insights you need
4. **Indicate Depth Level**: Specify if you need surface/intermediate/expert analysis
5. **Request Multi-Source Analysis**: Ask for 5-10+ authoritative sources explicitly
6. **Ask for Historical Context**: Request evolution, rationale, and lessons learned
7. **Specify Comparisons**: If evaluating options, ask for multi-dimensional comparison
