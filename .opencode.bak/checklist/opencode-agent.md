# OpenCode Agent Checklist

Comprehensive quality assurance checklist for creating and validating OpenCode agents.

**Purpose**: Ensure agents are properly configured, follow best practices, and integrate correctly with the OpenCode
system.

**When to use**: Creating new agents, reviewing existing agents, or validating agent configurations.

**Reference**: <https://opencode.ai/docs/agents/>

---

## Agent Configuration

### Required Frontmatter

- ✅ **description** field present (required for agent discovery)
- ✅ Description is clear and explains what agent does
- ✅ Description explains when to use the agent
- ✅ **mode** field set appropriately (`primary`, `subagent`, or `all`)
- ✅ Mode matches intended usage pattern

### Model Configuration

- ✅ **model** field specifies provider/model if overriding default
- ✅ Model format follows pattern: `provider/model-name`
- ✅ Model is appropriate for agent's purpose
- ✅ Model is available and accessible (verify with `opencode models`)

### Temperature Settings

- ✅ **temperature** set appropriately for agent type
- ✅ Temperature range is 0.0-1.0
- ✅ Temperature matches agent purpose:
    - `0.0-0.2`: Code analysis, planning, security audits (deterministic)
    - `0.3-0.5`: General development, balanced tasks
    - `0.6-1.0`: Brainstorming, creative tasks, exploration

### Optional Configuration

- ✅ **prompt** references external file if using custom system prompt
- ✅ Prompt file path is relative to config location
- ✅ Prompt file exists and is accessible
- ✅ **disable** flag set correctly (if agent should be disabled)
- ✅ Additional provider-specific options documented (e.g., `reasoningEffort` for OpenAI)

---

## Agent Types

### Primary Agents

**Mode**: `primary`

- ✅ Agent designed for main conversation handling
- ✅ Can be cycled through with Tab key
- ✅ Has appropriate tool access for primary use
- ✅ System prompt supports general interaction
- ✅ Temperature appropriate for direct user interaction

### Subagents

**Mode**: `subagent`

- ✅ Agent designed for specialized tasks
- ✅ Can be invoked with @ mention
- ✅ Can be invoked automatically by primary agents
- ✅ Description clearly explains specialization
- ✅ Tool access restricted to specific purpose
- ✅ System prompt focused on specialized task

### All-Mode Agents

**Mode**: `all`

- ✅ Agent can function as both primary and subagent
- ✅ System prompt supports both use cases
- ✅ Tool configuration appropriate for dual role
- ✅ Description explains both usage patterns

---

## Tool Configuration

### Tool Access Control

- ✅ **tools** section defines enabled/disabled tools
- ✅ Tool settings override global defaults appropriately
- ✅ Tool access matches agent purpose and security requirements
- ✅ Wildcard patterns used correctly (e.g., `mymcp_*: false`)

### Common Tool Patterns

#### Read-Only Agents

- ✅ `write: false`
- ✅ `edit: false`
- ✅ `bash: false` or restricted to safe commands
- ✅ Appropriate for planning, analysis, review agents

#### Development Agents

- ✅ `write: true`
- ✅ `edit: true`
- ✅ `bash: true`
- ✅ Appropriate for build, implementation agents

#### Documentation Agents

- ✅ `write: true` (for docs)
- ✅ `edit: true` (for updates)
- ✅ `bash: false` (no system commands needed)

#### Security Audit Agents

- ✅ `write: false` (no modifications)
- ✅ `edit: false` (no changes)
- ✅ `bash: true` but restricted (for scanning tools)

---

## Permission Configuration

### Permission Levels

- ✅ Permissions set appropriately: `ask`, `allow`, or `deny`
- ✅ Permission settings match agent security requirements
- ✅ Global permissions overridden per-agent when needed

### Edit Permissions

- ✅ **edit** permission set correctly
- ✅ `ask`: Prompts before file edits (recommended for most agents)
- ✅ `allow`: Auto-approves edits (use carefully)
- ✅ `deny`: Prevents all edits (read-only agents)

### Bash Permissions

- ✅ **bash** permission configured appropriately
- ✅ Global bash permission if all commands treated same
- ✅ Specific command permissions for granular control
- ✅ Glob patterns used for command groups (e.g., `git *: ask`)
- ✅ Wildcard `*` rule with specific overrides if needed
- ✅ Safe commands allowed (e.g., `git status: allow`)
- ✅ Dangerous commands restricted (e.g., `git push: ask`, `rm -rf *: deny`)

### WebFetch Permissions

- ✅ **webfetch** permission set if agent needs web access
- ✅ `ask`: Prompts before fetching URLs
- ✅ `allow`: Auto-approves web requests
- ✅ `deny`: Prevents web access

### Permission Examples

**Plan Agent** (read-only)

- ✅ `edit: ask` (prompt before changes)
- ✅ `bash: ask` (prompt before commands)

**Build Agent** (full access)

- ✅ `edit: ask` (prompt for safety)
- ✅ `bash: { "git push": "ask", "*": "allow" }` (ask before push)

**Security Agent** (restricted)

- ✅ `edit: deny` (no modifications)
- ✅ `bash: { "git diff": "allow", "git log*": "allow", "*": "ask" }`

---

## System Prompt Quality

### Prompt Content

- ✅ System prompt clearly defines agent role
- ✅ Prompt explains agent capabilities and limitations
- ✅ Prompt includes specific focus areas
- ✅ Prompt provides guidance on response format
- ✅ Prompt addresses when to use vs not use agent
- ✅ Prompt references relevant resources (checklists, templates, etc.)

### Prompt Structure

- ✅ Clear role definition at start
- ✅ Specific instructions for agent behavior
- ✅ Examples of expected output (if applicable)
- ✅ Guidelines for edge cases
- ✅ Resource references section (if applicable)

### Prompt Best Practices

- ✅ Language is clear and unambiguous
- ✅ Instructions are actionable
- ✅ Tone appropriate for agent type
- ✅ Avoids contradictory instructions
- ✅ Focuses on "why" not just "what"

---

## Agent File Organization
