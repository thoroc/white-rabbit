# OpenCode Command Checklist

Comprehensive quality assurance checklist for creating and validating OpenCode commands.

**Purpose**: Ensure commands are properly configured, follow best practices, and integrate correctly with the OpenCode
system.

**When to use**: Creating new commands, reviewing existing commands, or validating command configurations.

**Reference**: <https://opencode.ai/docs/commands/>

---

## Command Configuration

### Required Configuration

- ✅ **template** field present (the prompt sent to LLM)
- ✅ Template contains clear instructions
- ✅ Template is specific and actionable
- ✅ Template uses special syntax correctly ($ARGUMENTS, !`commands`, @files)
- ✅ **description** field present (shown in TUI)
- ✅ Description is clear and concise
- ✅ Description explains what command does

### Optional Configuration

- ✅ **agent** field specifies which agent executes command (if not default)
- ✅ Agent specified exists and is accessible
- ✅ **subtask** flag set appropriately (true for subagent invocation)
- ✅ **model** override set if specific model required
- ✅ Model format follows pattern: `provider/model-name`
- ✅ Model is available and accessible

---

## Command Location and Naming

### File Location

#### Global Commands

- ✅ Located in `~/.config/opencode/command/`
- ✅ Accessible across all projects
- ✅ Appropriate for general-purpose commands

#### Project-Specific Commands

- ✅ Located in `.opencode/command/`
- ✅ Only available in specific project
- ✅ Appropriate for project-specific workflows

### File Naming

- ✅ Filename is kebab-case (e.g., `run-tests.md`)
- ✅ Filename is descriptive of command purpose
- ✅ Filename becomes command name (e.g., `run-tests.md` → `/run-tests`)
- ✅ Extension is `.md` for markdown commands
- ✅ Command name doesn't conflict with built-in commands (unless intentional override)

### File Format

- ✅ Valid YAML frontmatter between `---` delimiters
- ✅ Markdown content (template) after frontmatter
- ✅ Proper indentation in YAML
- ✅ No syntax errors in frontmatter
- ✅ Template content is properly formatted

---

## Template Syntax Validation

### Arguments Handling

#### $ARGUMENTS Usage

- ✅ `$ARGUMENTS` placeholder used correctly (captures all arguments)
- ✅ Arguments usage documented in description
- ✅ Example usage clear to users
- ✅ Template explains what arguments are expected

#### Positional Arguments

- ✅ `$1, $2, $3...` used for specific arguments
- ✅ Positional argument numbers match expected count
- ✅ Template clearly indicates which argument is which
- ✅ Missing arguments handled gracefully
- ✅ Arguments documented in command description

**Example:**

```markdown
Create a file named $1 in the directory $2 with the following content: $3
```

### Shell Output Integration

#### !`command` Syntax

- ✅ Shell commands use correct syntax: !`command`
- ✅ Shell commands are safe and appropriate
- ✅ Shell commands run in project root directory
- ✅ Shell command output will be useful in prompt
- ✅ Shell commands won't expose sensitive information
- ✅ Shell commands have reasonable execution time
- ✅ Error handling considered for command failures

**Common Patterns:**

```markdown
!`npm test` # Test results !`git log -10` # Recent commits !`git status` # Git status !`ls -la` # Directory listing
```

**Security Checks:**

- ✅ No destructive commands (rm, delete, etc.)
- ✅ No commands that modify state without permission
- ✅ No commands that could expose secrets
- ✅ Commands are read-only or safe for execution

### File References

#### @filename Syntax

- ✅ File references use correct syntax: @path/to/file
- ✅ Referenced files typically exist in project
- ✅ File paths are relative to project root
- ✅ File references are necessary for command purpose
- ✅ Large files referenced only when needed
- ✅ File reference purpose clear in template

**Example:**

```markdown
Review the component in @src/components/Button.tsx
```

### Combined Syntax

- ✅ Multiple syntax types work together correctly
- ✅ Arguments, shell output, and file references don't conflict
- ✅ Template remains clear with multiple syntax types

**Example:**

```markdown
Review file @$1 and compare with git diff: !`git diff $1`
```

---

## Agent Configuration

### Agent Selection

- ✅ Agent field set appropriately for command purpose
- ✅ Agent has required tools for command execution
- ✅ Agent temperature suitable for command task
- ✅ Agent permissions allow command operations

### Agent Types

#### Default Agent

- ✅ No agent specified (uses current agent)
- ✅ Appropriate for general commands
- ✅ User can choose agent when running

#### Specific Agent

- ✅ Agent specified matches command purpose
- ✅ `agent: build` for development tasks
- ✅ `agent: plan` for analysis tasks
- ✅ Custom agents for specialized commands

#### Subagent Configuration

- ✅ `subtask: true` set if command should create child session
- ✅ Subagent invocation appropriate for command
- ✅ Prevents polluting primary context
- ✅ Forces agent to act as subagent even if mode is primary

---

## Model Override

### Model Configuration

- ✅ Model override only used when necessary
- ✅ Model format correct: `provider/model-name`
- ✅ Model appropriate for command purpose
- ✅ Model more capable for complex commands
- ✅ Model faster for simple commands

**Common Patterns:**

```yaml
model: anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022    # Powerful model
model: anthropic/claude-3-5-haiku-20241022     # Fast model
model: openai/gpt-4o                           # OpenAI option
```

---

## Template Quality

### Template Content

- ✅ Template provides clear instructions
- ✅ Template is specific and actionable
- ✅ Template context is sufficient for task
- ✅ Template explains what to do
- ✅ Template explains what to focus on
- ✅ Template provides constraints or guidelines
- ✅ Template includes success criteria (if applicable)

### Template Structure

- ✅ Instructions are logically organized
- ✅ Multiple steps are clearly separated
- ✅ Context provided before requests
