        - "- [ ] **[Main item]**:"
        - "  - [ ] [Sub-item 1]"
        - "  - [ ] [Sub-item 2]"
  notes:
    - "Include examples where helpful"
    - "Use tables for complex categorization"
    - "Add code blocks for technical examples"
    - "Link to related documentation or templates"

# Standard Section Types:

    format: "## 📊 Specialized Sections (as applicable)"
  
  - name: "Review/Validation Section"
    description: "Final checks before completion"
    format: "## 🔍 Review Checklist"

# Formatting Guidelines:

formatting:
  markdown_structure:
    headings:
      h1: "# [Title] - Main document title (use once)"
      h2: "## [Section] - Major sections (numbered or with emoji)"
      h3: "### [Subsection] - Subsections within major sections"
    
    checkboxes:
      basic: "- [ ] Item to check"
      bold_key: "- [ ] **Key Point**: Explanation"
      nested: "- [ ] Parent item\n  - [ ] Child item (indent 2 spaces)"
    
    emphasis:
      bold: "**[Important terms or key points]**"
      italic: "_[Emphasis or clarification]_"
      code: "`[Technical terms or commands]`"
    
    code_blocks: "```language\n[Example code or configuration]\n```"
    
    tables: "| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |\n|----------|----------|----------|\n| Item 1   | Item 2   | Item 3   |"
    
    separators: "Use --- for horizontal rules between major sections"
  
  emoji_usage:
    section_icons: ["📋 for checklist or requirements sections", "✅ for completion or validation sections", "🎯 for quality standards or goals", "📊 for specialized or conditional sections", "🔍 for review or inspection sections", "🚨 for warnings or critical sections", "🔧 for tools or utilities sections"]
    note: "Use emojis consistently but sparingly - typically only in H2 headers"

# Content Guidelines:

content_principles:
  clarity: ["Use clear, action-oriented language", "Avoid ambiguous terms like 'consider' or 'maybe'", "Be specific about what needs to be done or checked", "Define technical terms on first use"]
  completeness: ["Cover all critical aspects of the topic", "Include both happy path and edge cases", "Address common questions or issues", "Link to related documentation"]
  actionability: ["Each item should be verifiable (yes/no)", "Include examples where helpful", "Provide specific criteria or thresholds", "Link to tools or processes needed"]
  organization: ["Group related items together", "Order items logically (sequential or by priority)", "Use consistent formatting throughout", "Balance detail with readability"]
  audience: ["Consider who will use this checklist", "Adjust technical depth appropriately", "Include context for those less familiar", "Make it self-service when possible"]
